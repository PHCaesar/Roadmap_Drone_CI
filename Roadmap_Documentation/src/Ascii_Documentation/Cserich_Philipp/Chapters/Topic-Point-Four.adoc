## Usage - After Server Setup

Connect Drone to your Github account

### Configure Pipelines

Pipelines are used to automate your software delivery process. They are configured via the .drone.yml file, which needs to be placed in the root directory of the project.

[source,yml]
kind: pipeline
type: Docker
name: default
steps:
- name: test
  image: [Preffered Maven Image]
  commands:
  - mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
  - mvn test -B

#### Signing Config Files

### Configure Webhooks
The deployment **Trigger** needs to be set up before actually using Drone CI.
In our case, Github Webhooks do the job perfectly.
I would recommend configuring the Webhooks so that each main commit will be deployed onto Drone.


If everything happens to be setup in the correct way, Drone should execute all steps mentioned in the *.drone.yml* file
