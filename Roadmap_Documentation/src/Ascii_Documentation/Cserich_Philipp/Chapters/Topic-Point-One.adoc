## What is Drone CI?

Drone is a continuous integration and delivery **(CI/CD)** platform that provides a way to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and highly scalable, making it a popular choice for teams looking to streamline^[1]^ their software development and delivery processes.
The by far most popular tool operating in that field is called *Jenkins*.

With Drone, developers can define their CI/CD pipelines in a configuration file called .drone.yml that is stored in their code repository^[2]^. This file specifies the steps that should be taken to build, test, and deploy the code, as well as any dependencies or resources required. When a change is made to the code repository, Drone automatically triggers the pipeline to run, performing the specified steps in order.

Drone offers a wide range of features and integrations, including support for multiple programming languages and platforms, automatic dependency management, and integration with popular version control systems and cloud platforms. It also provides a web-based user interface for monitoring and managing pipelines, as well as APIs^[3]^ for integrating with other tools and systems including GitHub and Co.
